# HoustonBOLD (Black Owned, Latino, and Diversity)

The project is a web application that aggregates and displays event information from Eventbrite and Google for events happening in Houston. Users can browse events, filter by category and date range, and view detailed information about each event. The application will be focused on highlighting events from Black-owned businesses and other minority groups, with an emphasis on Black excellence. The goal is to create a go-to spot for finding the best events in Houston while promoting diversity and inclusivity.

Houston Events Finder is your go to spot for finding only the best events in Houston with a special eye for Black Owned Businesses.
